If it's just not wanting to deal with it herself, you might be able to compost the slurry just like humanure. Just set up a separate bin to dump it and make sure it gets to temperature.\n\nI manage a building that uses a Phoenix system. https://www.compostingtoilet.com/ it is still a composter, but for users it doesn't have the ick factor of a smaller system. We have it in a bed and breakfast so guests hardly notice the difference. And everything that comes out of it goes into a compost bin for an additional cycle before being used as soil."}, {"Comment ID": "kv02wt7", "Comment": "Chemical engineer here. You could cook the digestate. By cook I mean heat and pressurize the wet waste substrate to 200C and 20bar for 30min to an hour. To keep things sort, essentially turning crap into coal. The process conditions sterilize everything: Bacteria, viruses, worms, etc. Anything organic, is now a synthetic coal product. This coal can be burned without sewage odor or added into soil as an amender (process separates N and K from P via two products). Not the same as fertilizer sense were working with organics which have already been consumed so we're really only recovering a little bit of chemical fertilizer using the solid fraction (Mostly P, while N and K remain largely in liquid. Meta analysis of growth studies depict no affect or negative affect on biomass growth and seed germination. But looking into some of those studies, some of the testing methodology is flawed (like only using the synthetic coal as soil, which has no microbiome so obviously compared to crap soil which has a microbiome, it does worse.). It's not great to be mixed immediately into the garden but composted first. As for the liquid, N and K are recovered and can be sprayed over the garden. However it's acidic due to the process breaking down large organic structures into smaller organic acids. \n\nProbably useless as this does need a pressurized vessel and heating mantle (also pressure safety equipment) so it's expensive and hard to find unless custom built. But from my research on the topic, any human diseases are of no concern after cooking; After all any carbon organic lifeform in htc operating condition will transform them into coal."}, {"Comment ID": "kv5bp4l", "Comment": "You'd probably need more feedstock than just human poop to get a good amount of gas. Composting toilet might work better for your situation.
